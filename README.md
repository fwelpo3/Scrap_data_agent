## Version Deep Dive

**v1: Core Functionality**

* Initial scraper. Crawls websites with Selenium and analyzes each page's content individually using Gemini.  Good for understanding the fundamental scraping process.

**v2: Holistic Analysis**

* Saves raw page content and analyzes the *combined* website content with Gemini. Provides Gemini with website-wide context for potentially better insights.

**v3: Internationalized**

* Schema and prompts updated to English for broader use.  More generic data schema for wider website compatibility.

**v4: Smart & Efficient**

* **Key Upgrade:** Gemini now *prioritizes links* *before* crawling, focusing on the most promising pages first for faster, targeted results.

**v5: Asynchronous & Production-Ready**

* **Major Leap:**  Asynchronous crawling with `asyncio` and `httpx` for massive speed gains.  Robust with error handling, `robots.txt` respect, and concurrent Selenium management. Built for scale and reliability.

## Version Selector

* **Start Simple:** `v1` or `v2` for basic tasks and learning.
* **English Projects:** `v3` for immediate use on English websites.
* **Targeted Scraping:** `v4` for efficient, relevant data extraction.
* **Performance & Scale:** `v5` for large, fast, and robust scraping needs.  More complex setup but highest performance.

**ðŸ”‘ API Key Note:**  Remember to set your Gemini API key (`GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable for v5, or directly in code for older versions).
